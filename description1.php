                    Offer basic Bac +3 training in Mathematics, Computer Science.

                      This course brings together the study of disciplines from basic and applied mathematics. It naturally leads to a mention license

                      matrices are arrays of numbers which are used to interpret in theoretical, and therefore operational, terms the theoretical results of linear algebra and even bilinear algebra.

                        All disciplines studying linear phenomena use matrices. As for nonlinear phenomena, we often give linear approximations, as in geometric optics with Gaussian approximations.

                        A matrix with m rows and n columns is a rectangular array of m × n numbers, row by row. There are m lines, and in each line n numbers.

                         More formally and more generally, let I, J and K be three sets (K will often be provided with a ring structure or even with a commutative body).

                       We call matrix of type (I, J) 17 with coefficients in K, any family of elements of K indexed by the Cartesian product I × J, that is to say any map A of I × J in K.
